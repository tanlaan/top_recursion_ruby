# The Odin Project Recursion
## Ruby iteration versus recursion

### Assignment
1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.
2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
